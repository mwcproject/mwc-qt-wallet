        <p>This page lets you set specific parameters for the wallet. The parameters are as follows:</p>
        <ol style="-qt-list-indent: 1; margin: 10pt; margin-left: -15pt;">
            <li>Wallet folder name - This is the folder where all configuration and logging are stored.
                You can have multiple folders which store alternate instances of the MWC Qt Wallet. Change this value to create a new folder.
                <br/>Note: if you change this option you will be logged out and need to log in again.</li>
            <li>Number of confirmations - This is the number of confirmations before funds are available.
                By default, this will be set to 10 confirmations (note: the confirmation time is 1 minute, as opposed to Bitcoin which has 10 minute confirmations).
                This can be set to as low as 1 confirmation if desired.</li>
            <li>Change outputs - This is the number of change outputs. This feature is primarily used for
                debugging by developers, but generally a single change output is used. More than one may be specified here.<br>Note: higher transaction fees will apply.</li>
        </ol>
