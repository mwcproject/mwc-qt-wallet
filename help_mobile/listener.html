        <p>The most important function of this page is to obtain a new MWCMQS address.
            It is recommended that you create a new receiving address each time you accept funds.</p>
        <p>To do this, click the 'stop' button next to MWCMQS, then click 'next address'.
            Alternatively, you can go to a specific index by clicking on 'To index'.</p>
