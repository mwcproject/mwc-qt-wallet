        <p>This page lets you manage accounts. By default, MWC Qt Wallet has a single account called 'default',
            but you can add as many accounts as you like.</p>
        <p>The plus button allows you to add a new account. The refresh button updates the status of accounts, and the minus button allows you to delete accounts.
        You cannot delete your default account or an account that still has funds in it.</p>
        <p>The transfer button allows you to transfer to and from accounts. You select the "to" and "from" accounts and the amount, and the funds will be
            moved between accounts.</p>
