        <p>This page displays information about the full node that this MWC Qt Wallet is connected to, including online status,
            number of connections, number of blocks, and difficulty.</p>
        <p>Clicking "change node" allows you to connect to another node. If you want to run your
            own full node, you can specify it here.</p>
        <p>Re-sync with node performs a wallet resync. Sometimes the wallet state
            is out of sync with the network and you need to run a "Re-sync".</p>
