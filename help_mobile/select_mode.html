        <p>This page lets you choose whether you are running the MWC Qt Wallet as a standard online hot wallet
            (the default choice for most users), an "Online Node" which is used to submit transactions from cold
            storage, or a "Cold Wallet" which is used in conjunction with the "Online Node" and installed on a computer that never
            connects to the internet. Transactions are sent, received, and finalized on the "Cold Wallet" but submitted with the "Online Node"</p>
        <p>More details about Cold Wallet use cases can be found in our Cold Wallet Guide<br><a href="https://github.com/mwcproject/mwc-qt-wallet/blob/2019_09_cold_wallet/DOC/cold_wallet.md">https://github.com/mwcproject/mwc-qt-wallet/blob/2019_09_cold_wallet/DOC/cold_wallet.md</a></p>
