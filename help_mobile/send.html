        <p>MWC Qt Wallet supports several ways to send funds. They fall into two categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Online address-based sending.</li>
            <li>Offline Slatepack-based sending.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Several address types are supported.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>MWCMQS://&lt;address&gt; - This is MWCMQS (MWC Message Queue Service). We use a fork of Grinbox
                to allow users to quickly and easily send funds. The addresses may appear similar to Bitcoin addresses, but the main difference
                is that both wallets must be online at the time funds are sent. This is the default for the wallet.</li>
            <li>tor://&lt;address&gt; - Send via Tor. Try it even you believe that Tor can't work in your region. Both wallets must be online at the time funds are sent.</li>
        </ol>


        <p>Slatepack-based sending is an interactive 3-step process where the sender
            initiates a transaction and sends a Slatepack to the recipient. The recipient responds
            with a Slatepack that is sent back to the sender. The sender then finalizes the
            transaction. While this is the most advanced method of sending, it is also the most private.</p>
