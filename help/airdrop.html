<p style="line-height:150%;">MWC is an implementation of Mimblewimble with a limited supply of 20 million coins that will ever exist. Initially,
    we airdropped 6 million coins to all Bitcoin holders who registered their addresses. These coins were allocated proportionally
    to those who registered. You can check your BTC address at https://wallet.mwc.mw/registration.html?v5. You can also update your
    password at this site. You will be asked to do another signature in order to do so.</p>
<p style="line-height:150%;">On the airdrop tab, you can claim the coins you registered. First you will input your BTC address and the password which you
    set during the registration process. Then you will be given a string of characters to sign in order to claim your MWC.</p>
<p style="line-height:150%;">After entering the signature, your claim will be processed within 48 hours. At that time, your MWC will be available in your
    wallet.</p>
